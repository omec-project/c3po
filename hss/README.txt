     Instructions for External Modules" provided in
     {installation_root}/c3po/README.md_. Make sure these steps are complete.

  2. Build HSS.

       $ cd {isntallation_root}/c3po/hss
       $ make

  3. Update the following files with any configuration changes:

       {installation_root}/c3po/hss/conf/hss.conf
       {installation_root}/c3po/hss/conf/hss.json

  4. If this is the first time you are running the application, create the
